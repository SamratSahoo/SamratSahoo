# Hey! I'm [Samrat](https://samratsahoo.com)

Hello! I’m Samrat, a recent graduate from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I studied computer science with concentrations in artificial intelligence and low-level systems. This fall, I’ll be pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at Stanford University, focusing on artificial intelligence. I’m especially interested in research, particularly in reinforcement learning and its applications. In the past, my interests have spanned blockchains, federated learning, and economics.

***I’m currently working on:***
- Generative Exploration for Offline Reinforcement Learning

***Projects I've Finished***
- [Scatter Protocol](https://github.com/gtfintechlab/scatter-protocol): An Incentivized and Trustless Protocol for Decentralized Federated Learning - Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Blockchain
- [Roboflow Python Package](https://github.com/roboflow/roboflow-python): Interface with Roboflow API in Python -- my most popular project with 300,000+ monthly downloads! 
- [Bits of Good Analytics Platform](https://github.com/GTBitsOfGood/bog-analytics/): The unified analytics platform for Bits of Good
- [Healing4Heroes](https://github.com/GTBitsOfGood/Healing4Heroes): Accelerating Training for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Service Animals

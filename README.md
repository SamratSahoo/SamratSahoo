# Hey! I'm [Samrat](https://samratsahoo.com)

I love using computing to build new paradigms to solve the world's most pressing humanitarian issues. Reinforcement learning, blockchains, distributed systems, robotics, and economics are all fields that excite me! In my free time, you'll find me leading [Bits of Good](https://bitsofgood.org/), where I help nonprofits amplify their impact through computing.
